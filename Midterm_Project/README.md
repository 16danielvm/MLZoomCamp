# *Heart Attack Risk Analysis* 

## Problem Description

This project originates from a Kaggle competition with a crucial objective: predicting the risk of a patient experiencing a heart attack. Cardiovascular health is a global concern, and the ability to anticipate potential cardiovascular events can be a determining factor for early medical intervention and prevention.

### Context 

The dataset encompasses a wide range of features pertinent to heart health and lifestyle choices, covering patient-specific details such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and factors like diabetes, family history, smoking habits, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, it includes lifestyle elements such as exercise hours, dietary patterns, stress levels, and sedentary hours. Medical aspects, including prior heart issues, medication usage, and triglyceride levels, are taken into account. Socioeconomic factors like income and geographical attributes such as country, continent, and hemisphere are also integrated.

### Significance

Early prediction of cardiovascular risk can be crucial for informed medical decision-making. If this model can identify significant patterns and correlations in the data, it could become a valuable tool for healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the ability to efficiently perform risk assessments could enhance resource allocation and personalized care for patients.
